# Contributing to Icon Editor for LabVIEW

Hello there! So glad you want to help out with the LabVIEW Icon Editor ü§ó You‚Äôre the best. Here‚Äôs a guide for how you can contribute to the project.

# The Open Source LabVIEW Icon Editor

Just recently, the LabVIEW Icon Editor has been made open source to encourage collaboration between NI and the LabVIEW Community. Now you can find the source code of the LabVIEW Icon Editor in this repository. We are in a state of transition. This is the current structure:

* LabVIEW Icon Editor `labview-icon-editor` version {latest_version} is on branch {branch_name}
* The latest version of the LabVIEW Icon Editor (not published yet) can be found {latest_version_link}

# Our Contributing Philosophy

The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added, and which are left out, is decided by the core team, which includes NI staff and LabVIEW community volunteers (sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù style of development).

That being said, the Icon Editor is great because of the LabVIEW users who use it, share their code with the community, and discuss ways to make LabVIEW even better. Some of the most important and undervalued work in open source is from non-code contributions, and that is where we can use the most help from you.

# How can I help?

The things we need the most help for the library and its community are:

**üêõ Bug reports:** We simply can‚Äôt catch them all. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues/new/choose) and discussion first, then [create a new issue](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/issues/new/choose) to tell us what‚Äôs up.

**üí¨ Answering questions** in our {discussion_form} or {community_discord}.

üé¨ **Create tutorials**. Send them to us and we‚Äôll happily share them!

**‚úèÔ∏è Edit our [Docs](https://labview-icon-editor.dev/docs/introduction/)**: Make changes in the [labview-icon-editor-docs repo](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor-docs), or click the "edit this page‚Äù button that lives on every doc site.

All interactions should be done with care following our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Enhancements

If you have an idea or suggestion for an enhancement to the LabVIEW Icon Editor library, please use the [New Features](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features) discussion section. If you want to build it yourself, **please reach out to us before you dive into a new pull request.** The direction of the LabVIEW Icon Editor and which new features are added are discussed in our Discord Server and in [this GitHub discussions section](https://github.com/ni/labview-icon-editor/discussions/categories/new-features), and in the end, they are decided by the core team.

Talking to us first about the enhancement you want to build will be the most likely way to get your pull request into the library (see Our Contributing Philosophy above). We would hate to see you write code you‚Äôre proud of, just to learn that we‚Äôve already been working on the same thing, or that we feel doesn‚Äôt fit into the core library.
